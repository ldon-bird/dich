# dich
dich (pronounced "ditch") stands for DIsc CHanger, a profile/configuration file manager.

---

dich was written when I was binge-downloading data from the Corpenius Data Store. Its API uses a profile file for each account, and I needed to switch between them frequently.
It should be useful for similar uses.

# Usage
Before running, edit the `config.json` file based on your needs.

dich has four primary modes: init `-i`, get `-g`,next `-n`, and set `-s`. The modes are pretty much self-explanatory.

Use `dich -i` to initialize first before running other modes.

Use `dich -h` for a brief help message.
